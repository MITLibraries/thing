    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>You are receiving this message to confirm your successful submission of
either your ProQuest form, title page, and abstract or the electronic version of
your September 2017 thesis "MyString" to the MIT Libraries.
</p>

<p>If you submitted a February 2021 thesis, please note that only the
ProQuest form, title page, and abstract should have been submitted here. The
actual thesis should go directly to your department. For degree periods prior to
May 2020, we accept all electronic copies via this form.</p>

<p>You do not need to reply to this message.</p>

<p>Theses will be added to DSpace after degrees have been awarded and the thesis
has been fully processed by the MIT Libraries (typically 3-6 months after the
degree date).</p>

<p>If you require further assistance, please send an email to
etheses-admin@mit.edu.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />
MIT Libraries</p>

<p>We would like your feedback!<br />
