    per author) and must be submitted by 30 days after graduation.</li>
    <li>Confirm each thesis PDF meets the required thesis specifications 
    prior to submitting them to the Libraries. <strong>Pay specific 
    attention to the information on the title page.</strong></li>
    <li>Upload individual thesis files (can be done as a bulk upload). 
    We can no longer accept zip files.</li>
    <li>All theses must be transferred as PDF files using the following 
    file naming convention - [last/surname-kerberos-degree-dept-year-file.pdf].
